## Challenges
1.  To make the server supports multiple interactive games, each with multiple players
2. To make all the classes interact with each other
3. Ensuring thread safety while managing synchronization to avoid deadlocks in a multiplayer environment.
## Issues
1. A Problem with connecting multiple players on the server.
2. Crashes and Bugs: If errors or unexpected issues aren't handled well, they could cause the game or the server to crash, leaving players hanging.
3. Testing aspect: including integration and overall intensive tests, to ensure it performs reliably under any conditions with multiple users.
4. No investors in the field.
